**Query Diversity:** Generate mix of academic AND industry queries for source diversity:

Academic-focused queries (route to Crossref/Semantic Scholar):
- "peer-reviewed studies on [topic]"
- "systematic review of [topic]"
- "author:Smith [topic]"
- "title:empirical analysis [topic]"
- "meta-analysis [topic]"

Industry-focused queries (route to Gemini Grounded/web search):
- "McKinsey report [topic]"
- "Gartner analysis [topic]"
- "WHO guidelines [topic]"
- "OECD [topic] framework"
- "European Commission [topic] regulation"
- "BCG white paper [topic]"
- "IEEE standards [topic]"
- "NIST [topic] best practices"

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown blocks or explanations.
